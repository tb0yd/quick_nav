= quick_nav

This project is designed to provide a fast HTML nav generator for Rails. The strategy I am using in the project is to avoid looping and creating objects.

The project has not reached a release quality state yet. If you want to include it or fork it, look in the specs for guidance on how to write navigation.rb.
